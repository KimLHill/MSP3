# **Testing**

## **User Stories**
I tested the user stories based on the users outlined in the User Stories section of my README.md file.

1. **User 1** - I am the owner of the website, I want to promote the user of my protein powder supplement in recipes, to sell more of my product.

	This user promotes their protein powder supplement in several ways. Firstly, on the home page when the user arrives at the website, the first thing they see if a carousel displaying a selection of images that clearly show and promote this user’s product. At the bottom of every page is a header asking website users “Do you need whey protein?” and a button below that provides a quick and easy link to this user’s shop selling where customers can buy the protein powder.

2. **User 2** - I am a dietician wanting to share my healthy, nutritionally-balanced recipes with other people.

	This user can achieve their goal by firstly creating an account via the registration page and then selecting the ‘Add recipe’ tab where they will find the form to upload their own recipes. The form includes method, ingredients as well as calories and macronutrient (protein, carbohydrate and fat) information to show that the recipes are nutritionally-balanced. By clicking the ‘Add recipe’ button, this user shares their recipe with other people to achieve their goal.

3. **User 3** - I am new to cooking, I want to find healthy recipes with simple, easy cooking instructions, so I can learn to cook my own meals.

	This user can achieve their goal by selecting the ‘Recipes’ tab on the navbar or clicking the ‘Find recipes’ button on the home page, which will take them to the recipes page. This user can then search for recipes by name or description. To easily identify simple and easy recipes, the utensils icon provides quick visual feedback that it is an easy recipe. A tooltip stating “Quick & easy recipe” further helps this user to identify simple recipes suitable for them as a new cook.

4. **User 4** - I am a bodybuilder, I want to find recipes, to cook meals that fit my calorie and macronutrient needs.

	This user can find recipes via selecting the ‘Recipes’ tab on the navbar or clicking the ‘Find recipes’ button on the home page, which will take them to the recipes page. This user can then click on a recipe (which they are prompted to do by the dropdown arrow symbol) which displays further information on the recipe, including the calorie and macronutrient (protein, carbohydrate & fat) information that this user wants.

5. **User 5** - I am a user who has submitted a recipe, I have since improved my recipe and want to update the recipe to improve it.

	This user can achieve their goal by firstly logging in to their account, which takes them to their profile page.  This user can then click the ‘Recipes’ button in their profile page or the ‘Recipes’ tab on the navbar. On the recipes page, this user will see a ‘Delete’ and an ‘Edit’ button next to the recipes that they have added. This user can select the ‘Edit’ button and make their desired changes. They can then either press the ‘Cancel’ button to discard their changes or click the ‘Edit recipe’ button to make their changes.
